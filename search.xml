    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Chemistry-Experiment-Puerarin-Content-Analysis-in-Kudzu-Root-Powder-🧪"><a href="#Chemistry-Experiment-Puerarin-Content-Analysis-in-Kudzu-Root-Powder-🧪" class="headerlink" title="Chemistry Experiment: Puerarin Content Analysis in Kudzu Root Powder 🧪"></a>Chemistry Experiment: Puerarin Content Analysis in Kudzu Root Powder 🧪</h1><p>Hello everyone, I’m William, a high school student who loves doing chemistry experiments.</p>
<p>First, let me ask you a question: Have you or your family ever bought something called “kudzu root powder”?</p>
<p>We buy it for all those amazing benefits advertised - like protecting cardiovascular health, relieving menopausal symptoms, and detoxifying the liver. But as a student passionate about chemistry, I always think one step further: <strong>What’s actually behind these miraculous effects?</strong></p>
<h2 id="The-Secret-Molecule-Puerarin-🔬"><a href="#The-Secret-Molecule-Puerarin-🔬" class="headerlink" title="The Secret Molecule: Puerarin 🔬"></a>The Secret Molecule: Puerarin 🔬</h2><p>The answer lies in this tiny molecule - <strong>Puerarin</strong>!</p>
<p>Puerarin is the core active ingredient in kudzu root powder. But here’s the problem: the quality of kudzu root powder on the market varies dramatically. Some products might have puerarin content so low that you can’t even imagine!</p>
<p>You think you’re buying a “health guardian,” but in reality, you might just be getting an expensive can of useless starch!</p>
<h2 id="Scientific-Investigation-with-HPLC-📊"><a href="#Scientific-Investigation-with-HPLC-📊" class="headerlink" title="Scientific Investigation with HPLC 📊"></a>Scientific Investigation with HPLC 📊</h2><p>How deep does this rabbit hole go? To uncover the truth, I returned to the professional laboratory and brought out our old friend - <strong>High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)</strong>!</p>
<p>Let me explain how this machine works. It’s like an ultra-high precision “subway security conveyor belt.” We put the kudzu root powder extract into it, and it can precisely separate the puerarin from other components based on molecular structure and polarity differences. Then, under UV light, puerarin strongly absorbs light at specific wavelengths, producing a signal peak. The stronger this signal, the higher the content.</p>
<h2 id="Experimental-Process-🔬"><a href="#Experimental-Process-🔬" class="headerlink" title="Experimental Process 🔬"></a>Experimental Process 🔬</h2><h3 id="Sample-Preparation"><a href="#Sample-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="Sample Preparation"></a>Sample Preparation</h3><p>To determine the core health component ‘puerarin’ content in these commercial kudzu root powders, we brought samples purchased from <strong>Hangzhou, Zhejiang</strong> and <strong>Shangrao, Jiangxi</strong> into the laboratory with a scientific truth-seeking spirit.</p>
<h3 id="Standard-Curve-Establishment"><a href="#Standard-Curve-Establishment" class="headerlink" title="Standard Curve Establishment"></a>Standard Curve Establishment</h3><p>First, we established a ‘standard curve’ - the foundation of all accurate quantitative analysis. Since HPLC instruments cannot directly measure concentration, they measure the signal response value produced by substances, which we call ‘peak area.’</p>
<p>Using high-purity ‘puerarin standard,’ we precisely prepared a series of standard solutions with known concentrations: 6.25, 12.5, 24.99, 37.49, 49.99, 62.49 mg&#x2F;L.</p>
<p>We injected these standard solutions into the instrument for analysis, obtaining the corresponding signal peak area for each concentration. Using concentration as the x-axis and peak area as the y-axis, through linear regression calculation, we obtained a calibration curve and its regression equation: <strong>y &#x3D; 35.441x - 11.706</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Sample-Processing"><a href="#Sample-Processing" class="headerlink" title="Sample Processing"></a>Sample Processing</h3><p>We used an electronic balance to precisely weigh 0.1 grams of kudzu root powder from each sample. After adding approximately 80 mL of 30% ethanol solution as extraction solvent, we used ultrasonic cleaning for 30 minutes to maximize puerarin extraction.</p>
<p>After cooling to room temperature, we diluted to exactly 100 mL with 30% ethanol solution. Finally, we filtered the supernatant through a needle filter membrane and injected it into sample vials.</p>
<h2 id="Results-and-Analysis-📈"><a href="#Results-and-Analysis-📈" class="headerlink" title="Results and Analysis 📈"></a>Results and Analysis 📈</h2><p>The detection results for both kudzu root powder samples are in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hangzhou sample</strong>: 8.5% puerarin content</li>
<li><strong>Jiangxi Shangrao sample</strong>: 1.5% puerarin content</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, both samples we tested had relatively low effective puerarin content. This is the objective fact from our detection:</p>
<p><strong>Some ordinary kudzu root powders on the market, despite advertising high puerarin content, may actually have surprisingly low effective ingredient levels.</strong></p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-💡"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-💡" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways 💡"></a>Key Takeaways 💡</h2><p>Through this scientific experiment, we’ve summarized three important points:</p>
<p><strong>First, don’t just look at commercial advertising.</strong> Descriptions like ‘pure natural’ and ‘high content’ need data support.</p>
<p><strong>Second, learn to identify effective information.</strong> When purchasing health products, pay attention to their ingredient content tables. If merchants can clearly mark effective ingredient content in standardized units like ‘mg&#x2F;g’, it has more reference value.</p>
<p><strong>Third, have reasonable expectations for product efficacy.</strong> Based on our experimental results, the effective ingredient content in ordinary commercial kudzu root powder is limited. This doesn’t mean it’s completely ineffective, but if you expect significant health benefits, you might need to reconsider dosage or choose other purified, concentrated products with clearly marked high-content standards.</p>
<p>We conducted this experiment hoping that everyone will make rational purchases when buying kudzu root powder and other health products in the future.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Labubu天价大揭秘：一场被”化学公式”操控的疯狂购物派对！🧪💰"><a href="#Labubu天价大揭秘：一场被”化学公式”操控的疯狂购物派对！🧪💰" class="headerlink" title="Labubu天价大揭秘：一场被”化学公式”操控的疯狂购物派对！🧪💰"></a>Labubu天价大揭秘：一场被”化学公式”操控的疯狂购物派对！🧪💰</h1><p>嘿，各位实验室预备役！最近被Labubu那个丑萌小怪物刷屏了吧？动辄上万的价格，看得人下巴都掉了！作为一个化学爱好者，我在这股狂热风暴里，居然闻到了熟悉的”实验室味道”——这哪是买玩具，分明就是一场精心设计的超大型”化学反应”！</p>
<p>今天，咱们就用化学的”显微镜”，把这场狂欢拆解得明明白白！</p>
<p>![image-20250718160225309](&#x2F;Users&#x2F;linqingwen&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;typora-user-images&#x2F;image-20250718160225309.png)</p>
<h2 id="1-“稀有元素”大作战：越少越贵，铁律！⚗️"><a href="#1-“稀有元素”大作战：越少越贵，铁律！⚗️" class="headerlink" title="1. “稀有元素”大作战：越少越贵，铁律！⚗️"></a>1. “稀有元素”大作战：越少越贵，铁律！⚗️</h2><p>化学课学过吧？金子、铂金为啥贵上天？就因为它们在地球上太太太少了！Labubu的价格火箭，玩的也是这套”稀有法则”。</p>
<p>比如全球只有7000个的初代薄荷色Labubu，或者少到只有15个的巨型款，简直就像元素周期表最角落、最难找的”神秘元素”！它们一”稀有”，身价立刻像坐了火箭，”噌”地来个超级大跳跃！</p>
<p>这道理放哪儿都通！想想你追的限量版球鞋，或者超难抢的爱豆周边，是不是也这样？东西越少，抢的人越多，价格就”咻”地飞上天！跟实验室里找不到关键原料，整个实验就得烧钱一个道理！</p>
<p>![image-20250718160305079](&#x2F;Users&#x2F;linqingwen&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;typora-user-images&#x2F;image-20250718160305079.png)</p>
<h2 id="2-“情感粘合剂”：为啥我们心甘情愿掏空钱包？💝"><a href="#2-“情感粘合剂”：为啥我们心甘情愿掏空钱包？💝" class="headerlink" title="2. “情感粘合剂”：为啥我们心甘情愿掏空钱包？💝"></a>2. “情感粘合剂”：为啥我们心甘情愿掏空钱包？💝</h2><p>灵魂拷问：一个塑料小玩偶，凭啥让人掏几千几万？秘密武器就是——无形的”情感粘合剂”！</p>
<p>Labubu那又丑又萌的怪样子，就像自带”魔力小钩子”（化学里叫特定官能团），精准地”钩”住了我们的审美点和小心脏，产生了超强的”情感共鸣”。一旦被”钩”住，就像强力胶（化学里类似超强的分子间吸引力），甩都甩不掉！</p>
<p>这时候，为它多花点”爱的供养”（远超成本的钱），简直不要太合理！这跟为啥有人花大价钱买偶像签名球衣、限量球鞋一个道理！那上面的签名、特殊设计，都带着偶像的”情感能量”，在粉丝心里形成了独一无二的”情感分子”，是身份和热爱的超级标签！</p>

<p>买盲盒？根本不是买玩具，是买一次”心跳抽奖券”！你永远不知道拆开是普通款还是金光闪闪的隐藏款（概率超低！），这感觉，跟买彩票等着中大奖一模一样！刺激吧？</p>
<p>品牌限量发售、搞联名，就像给反应疯狂”加热加压”，让市场热度直接爆表！体育品牌玩的”抽签发售”也是这招！把买买买的资格变成”拼手气”，人为制造稀缺感，精准操控大家的购买欲，热度瞬间拉满！</p>
<p>![image-20250718160316094](&#x2F;Users&#x2F;linqingwen&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;typora-user-images&#x2F;image-20250718160316094.png)</p>
<h2 id="4-“价格过山车”：小心！泡沫随时会”嘭”！📈📉"><a href="#4-“价格过山车”：小心！泡沫随时会”嘭”！📈📉" class="headerlink" title="4. “价格过山车”：小心！泡沫随时会”嘭”！📈📉"></a>4. “价格过山车”：小心！泡沫随时会”嘭”！📈📉</h2><p>化学里有可逆反应，条件一变，平衡就动。Labubu市场也像个超敏感的”化学跷跷板”。</p>
<p>当热度（温度）飙升，热钱（反应物）疯狂涌入，价格（产物）就一飞冲天！BUT！一旦热度降温，或者官方突然补货、出新款（相当于改变条件），或者有人管了（政府出手），这个”跷跷板”立马倒向另一边，价格”哗啦”就掉下来！</p>
<p>更要命的是”庄家”捣鬼！有些炒家和资本，就像混进实验里的”杂质”或”神秘催化剂”，他们囤货、放消息、搞假拍卖，把某个款式价格像吹气球一样吹上天（暂时打破平衡）。这操作，跟赌场里庄家操控赔率有啥区别？</p>
<p>但气球吹太大总会爆！当没人接盘，或者”庄家”赚够跑路，价格雪崩就在眼前！想想某些被炒到天价又暴跌的限量球鞋，或者曾经贵上天、现在满地跑的新材料（比如石墨烯手机壳），都是活生生的”泡沫破裂”案例！</p>
<p>刺激是真刺激，危险也是真危险！</p>

<p>所以，实验室守则第一条是什么？<strong>保持清醒和理性！</strong>尤其是面对盲盒这种”心跳游戏”和被炒到离谱的”天价神物”。</p>
<p>别被限量光环闪瞎眼！问问自己：它真是值得珍藏的”传家宝”，还是转眼就凉的”泡沫玩具”？</p>

    <title>Chemistry Experiment - Tea Polyphenol Content Analysis in Different Tea Varieties</title>
    <url>/2024/12/19/chemistry-experiment-tea-polyphenol-analysis/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Chemistry-Experiment-Tea-Polyphenol-Content-Analysis-in-Different-Tea-Varieties-🍃"><a href="#Chemistry-Experiment-Tea-Polyphenol-Content-Analysis-in-Different-Tea-Varieties-🍃" class="headerlink" title="Chemistry Experiment: Tea Polyphenol Content Analysis in Different Tea Varieties 🍃"></a>Chemistry Experiment: Tea Polyphenol Content Analysis in Different Tea Varieties 🍃</h1><p>Hello everyone, I’m William, a high school student who loves doing chemistry experiments.</p>
<p><strong>As a native of Hangzhou</strong>, if someone asks me what my hometown tastes like, my answer has always been certain:</p>
<p>“It’s the taste of the first brew of West Lake Longjing in spring.”</p>
<h2 id="The-Question-Is-West-Lake-Longjing-Worth-Its-Price-💰"><a href="#The-Question-Is-West-Lake-Longjing-Worth-Its-Price-💰" class="headerlink" title="The Question: Is West Lake Longjing Worth Its Price? 💰"></a>The Question: Is West Lake Longjing Worth Its Price? 💰</h2><p>West Lake Longjing, known as the “Queen of Green Tea,” carries deep historical and cultural significance. Since ancient times, it has been a symbol of Jiangnan elegance.</p>
<p>Many people’s most direct question is about price: Why is it so expensive? Is it really worth the money?</p>
<p>And most crucially, regarding actual strength: In today’s world, when it comes to nutritional content and actual efficacy, does it still have advantages compared to other premium teas?</p>
<p>These practical questions have made “West Lake Longjing” seem to gradually transform from a synonym for quality into a controversial symbol in some people’s eyes.</p>
<p>Facing these questions, talking only about culture and sentiment seems somewhat pale and powerless. We need an objective, scientific ruler to re-measure its value.</p>
<p><strong>And this ruler is - Tea Polyphenols!</strong></p>
<h2 id="The-Science-Behind-Tea-Polyphenols-🔬"><a href="#The-Science-Behind-Tea-Polyphenols-🔬" class="headerlink" title="The Science Behind Tea Polyphenols 🔬"></a>The Science Behind Tea Polyphenols 🔬</h2><p>You should be familiar with this term. Simply put, tea’s unique flavors - like freshness and astringency - as well as its widely known health benefits, are all closely related to this core substance. Tea polyphenols are the core functional components of various teas, with antioxidant and anti-aging effects. Accurately measuring their content is crucial for evaluating tea quality and developing health products.</p>
<p>So, what is West Lake Longjing’s actual strength?</p>
<h2 id="Experimental-Design-📊"><a href="#Experimental-Design-📊" class="headerlink" title="Experimental Design 📊"></a>Experimental Design 📊</h2><p>I decided to start a scientific investigation through chemical methods!</p>
<p>In this video, we will use the most rigorous experiments and the most intuitive data to directly respond to all previous questions.</p>
<p>First, we collected eight tea varieties:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-priced West Lake Longjing</li>
<li>Da Hong Pao</li>
<li>Xiangxi Green Tea</li>
<li>Lower-priced Hangzhou Longjing</li>
<li>Qimen Black Tea</li>
<li>Shantou Green Tea</li>
<li>Huangshan Green Tea</li>
<li>Fujian Green Tea</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, we entered the laboratory to measure the tea polyphenol content of these teas using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) technology.</p>
<h2 id="HPLC-Methodology-🧪"><a href="#HPLC-Methodology-🧪" class="headerlink" title="HPLC Methodology 🧪"></a>HPLC Methodology 🧪</h2><p>Let me first introduce High-Performance Liquid Chromatography:</p>
<p>We need to know that tea leaf extract is a mixture, with EGCG being the main component we want to measure in this experiment.</p>
<p>HPLC’s first task is to separate them - this process is called ‘separation.’</p>
<p>The core of HPLC is a tube called a ‘chromatographic column,’ filled with special analytical material called the ‘stationary phase.’</p>
<p>Once the experiment begins, a specific liquid - the ‘mobile phase’ - continuously pushes our sample through this chromatographic column.</p>
<p>Here’s the key: when the sample flows through the column, different molecules interact with the ‘stationary phase’ material at different intensities. Some molecules experience strong attraction and move slowly; others experience weak attraction and are quickly carried forward by the ‘mobile phase.’</p>
<p>Due to this speed difference, originally mixed molecules are separated and eventually flow out of the column one after another.</p>
<p>The second step is <strong>detection</strong>.</p>
<p>At the column exit, a <strong>UV detector</strong> waits, emitting 278-nanometer wavelength UV light to illuminate the flowing liquid. Tea polyphenol molecules have strong absorption characteristics for this wavelength.</p>
<p>So when tea polyphenols flow through the detector, they absorb some light, generating a signal. The higher the concentration of these molecules in the sample, the more light absorbed, and the stronger the signal generated.</p>
<p>Finally, the computer plots these signals of varying strengths into a spectrum. Each ‘peak’ on the graph represents a separated component, and the peak size (area) directly tells us the accurate content of that component.</p>
<p><strong>Simply put, HPLC first separates mixtures through speed differences, then measures their quantities one by one.</strong></p>
<h2 id="Experimental-Process-🔬"><a href="#Experimental-Process-🔬" class="headerlink" title="Experimental Process 🔬"></a>Experimental Process 🔬</h2><h3 id="Sample-Processing"><a href="#Sample-Processing" class="headerlink" title="Sample Processing"></a>Sample Processing</h3><p>To measure tea polyphenol EGCG content, the first step is sample preprocessing, aiming to effectively extract tea polyphenols from tea leaves.</p>
<p>First, we ground tea leaves into powder and precisely weighed 0.2 grams using an analytical balance.</p>
<p>Then, we added 10 mL of 75% ethanol solution.</p>
<p>Finally, we took the supernatant and filtered it through microporous filter membranes to remove tiny particles and prevent instrument clogging. Now we have pure tea leaf sample solution for analysis.</p>
<h3 id="Standard-Curve"><a href="#Standard-Curve" class="headerlink" title="Standard Curve"></a>Standard Curve</h3><p>Before measuring unknown concentration tea samples, we must first perform a step called ‘plotting standard curve’ - this is the foundation ensuring our quantitative accuracy.</p>
<p>We prepared a series of tea polyphenol standard solutions with completely known concentrations: 50, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 μg&#x2F;mL, etc. Then we injected these standard solutions into HPLC sequentially, measuring their corresponding signal peak areas.</p>
<p>By plotting concentration as x-axis and peak area as y-axis, we obtained a straight line and its mathematical regression equation: <strong>y &#x3D; 5.6696x - 40.77</strong>. The R² value is 0.9914, very close to 1, indicating this conversion relationship is very reliable.</p>
<h3 id="Instrumental-Analysis"><a href="#Instrumental-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Instrumental Analysis"></a>Instrumental Analysis</h3><p>With all preparations complete, we began formal analysis. We placed eight processed tea samples into the HPLC autosampler.</p>
<p>The instrument automatically and precisely extracted each sample according to preset programs and injected them into the analysis system. As explained earlier, various components in samples are separated in the chromatographic column, then recorded one by one by the detector.</p>
<h2 id="Results-and-Analysis-📈"><a href="#Results-and-Analysis-📈" class="headerlink" title="Results and Analysis 📈"></a>Results and Analysis 📈</h2><p>All sample instrumental analyses are complete. Through HPLC determination and calculation based on the previously established standard curve, we obtained specific tea polyphenol concentrations in eight tea samples:</p>
<p><strong>Processed Tea Varieties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Da Hong Pao (Sample #2): 224.7 mg&#x2F;L</li>
<li>Qimen Black Tea (Sample #5): 257.2 mg&#x2F;L</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Green Tea Varieties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fujian Green Tea (Sample #8): 283.0 mg&#x2F;L</li>
<li>Hangzhou Longjing (Sample #4): 370.7 mg&#x2F;L</li>
<li>Shantou Green Tea (Sample #6): 593.5 mg&#x2F;L</li>
<li>Mystery Valley Golden Green Tea (Sample #3): 856.9 mg&#x2F;L</li>
<li>Huangshan Green Tea (Sample #7): 891.3 mg&#x2F;L</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Note - West Lake Longjing:</strong><br>Sample #1 ‘West Lake Longjing’ had initial tea polyphenol concentration significantly exceeding the instrument’s optimal linear detection range, so we performed necessary dilution according to protocol. Based on the diluted concentration measured by the instrument and multiplying by the corresponding dilution factor, we calculated its original tea polyphenol concentration as <strong>2822.4 mg&#x2F;L</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Findings-🎯"><a href="#Key-Findings-🎯" class="headerlink" title="Key Findings 🎯"></a>Key Findings 🎯</h2><p>The quantitative results clearly show: Sample #1 ‘West Lake Longjing’ has tea polyphenol content significantly higher than all other tested samples. This value is approximately 3.2 times that of ‘Huangshan Green Tea’ (the second highest) and about 7.6 times that of ‘Hangzhou Longjing’ (Sample #4).</p>
<p>The data clearly reveals that different teas, especially different quality grades of the same tea type, can have order-of-magnitude differences in core chemical component content.</p>
<h2 id="Analysis-and-Recommendations-💡"><a href="#Analysis-and-Recommendations-💡" class="headerlink" title="Analysis and Recommendations 💡"></a>Analysis and Recommendations 💡</h2><p>This experiment’s core finding is that the same West Lake Longjing - our deliberately selected high-priced sample versus another affordable sample - showed vastly different content in the core effective component, tea polyphenol EGCG. The high-priced West Lake Longjing not only had the highest concentration among all samples but was several times higher than the affordable Longjing sample.</p>
<p>What causes this? This is usually directly related to <strong>raw material grade, harvesting time, growing environment, and production techniques</strong>. For example, high-grade Longjing is typically harvested in early spring when tea tree buds have accumulated nutrients throughout winter, making their tea polyphenols and amino acids most abundant. Meanwhile, top-tier tea-making techniques minimize the loss of these active substances during processing.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, I offer three recommendations:</p>
<p><strong>First, clarify needs and choose rationally.</strong> If you drink tea mainly for flavor enjoyment and relaxation, any qualified tea meeting safety standards will satisfy you. But if, like us, you view tea drinking as a health investment hoping to maximize tea polyphenol and other antioxidant components, this experiment clearly points to: <strong>Under economically feasible conditions, choosing certified, high-quality West Lake Longjing from core production areas may provide higher effective component returns.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Second, learn to distinguish and focus on origin.</strong> Since quality is so closely related to origin, we cannot just look at price when purchasing. Try to buy through reputable brands or merchants and actively pay attention to product origin information. Genuine West Lake Longjing has geographical indication protection - look for relevant certifications and anti-counterfeiting marks when purchasing.</p>
<p><strong>Third, proper storage preserves nutrition.</strong> Even with top-grade tea, improper storage will cause tea polyphenols to rapidly degrade due to light, high temperature, humidity, and oxidation. The correct approach is storing tea in opaque, well-sealed containers in cool, dry, dark places. This maximizes preservation of the health value we paid for.</p>
<p>In conclusion, through this complete experiment from sample processing to data analysis, we hope everyone can make rational tea purchases.</p>

    <title>Coding for a Cause: Our Software Development Club at the 2025 Love Cube Charity Day</title>
    <url>/2025/05/28/coding-for-a-cause-charity-day/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This past May, I had the incredible opportunity to represent my Software Development Club at Pinghe’s third annual “Love Cube” Charity Day on May 28th. It was a day filled with joy, community, and the shared goal of making a difference. This year’s event was a collaboration with the Shanghai Pudong New Area Fudu School, aimed at supporting vocational training and sustainable employment for young people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>Our club decided to get creative with our fundraising efforts. We set up a booth to sell lottery tickets and were thrilled to see the enthusiastic response from fellow students, teachers, and parents. The energy at the event was amazing, with a bustling charity market during the day and a spectacular “Blazing Light” charity gala in the evening.</p>
<p>I am incredibly proud to announce that through our lottery ticket sales, the Software Development Club raised ¥1356! This achievement placed us among the top five fundraising booths at the entire charity market. In total, the “Love Cube” Charity Day raised an impressive ¥40,732. All proceeds will be donated to the three vocational training workshops at the Fudu School, directly helping these talented young individuals build their professional skills.</p>
<p>It was so inspiring to see our school community come together. From the energetic performances at the gala to the creative booths at the market, every part of the day was a testament to the power of collective action. Our club was honored to be a part of this meaningful event, using our passion for technology and problem-solving to contribute to a cause we care about. This experience has been a powerful reminder that we can all use our skills, no matter what they are, to create positive change.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who bought a ticket from our booth and supported our efforts. We can’t wait to see how we can continue to code for a cause in the future!</p>
